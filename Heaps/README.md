# Binary Heaps: 

  A data structure that is binary tree that is either ordered as min-heap or max-heap. 

   - **Max binary heap** : A binary tree that has parent nodes that are larger than child nodes. 
   - **Min binary heap** : A binary tree that has parents nodes smaller than child nodes. 
   
  There is no implied ordering between children nodes.

# Use cases: 
 - Commonly used to implement a Priority Queue.
 - Used for graph traversal algorithms.
