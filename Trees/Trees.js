// TREES: 

// A data structure that consists of nodes in parent and child relationship. 
// Trees are nonlinear 
// Root is top node in a tree 
// A child directly connected to another node when movin away from the root. 
// A sibilings are nodes with the same parent. 
// A leaf is node with no children. 
// Edge is the connection between one node and another.


// Breadth first search is visiting every node by each level
// Depth first search is visiting every node down a branch
